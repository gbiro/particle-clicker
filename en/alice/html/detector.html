<p class="lead">What are particle detectors?</p>

<p>
Particle detectors can be thought of as high-tech cameras that take “photographs” of phenomena that physicists want to study. These phenomena may originate in nuclear decays, cosmic radiation or interactions in a particle accelerator. Let us take a closer look at detectors such as those used at the LHC, which consist of layers of specialized components each designed to specific particles and identify certain properties.
